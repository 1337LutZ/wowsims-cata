**THIS IS IN TESTING, THE ADDON MAY NOT WORK**
If this is the case, don't open a ticket on the wowsims github, open it here <https://github.com/generalwrex/wowsimsexporter/issues>

**Getting the addon**

If anyone would like to test it, you can just download the repository and put the `wowsimsexporter` folder in your addons directory. 


**To use the addon**

    /wse - will open up the options window - *wip* changes do nothing atm
    /wse open - will open the exporter window.
    /wse export will open the exporter window, generate the data, and have the data ready and highlighted for you to CTRL+C

If you change your gear, and enchants or some gems, you can either rerun `/wse export` if you closed the window and the data will be updated. or just click the `Generate Data` button.

**To find the import button on WoWSims**

As this is in a testing phase, the addon button his hidden from the website to avoid issues with users not knowing where the addon is!

To find the import button you can see it by going to the options cogwheel and enabling experimental features, it will then appear under Import!

This will add a import button to the top right of the page to the right of the report a feature button.
